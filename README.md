# Tetris Autoplayer

This project implements a Tetris Autoplayer that uses a heuristic-based approach to optimize gameplay and achieve high scores. It evaluates potential block placements based on key metrics like minimizing holes, reducing surface bumpiness, and maximizing row clears. The system dynamically adjusts weights assigned to these metrics to improve decision-making.
